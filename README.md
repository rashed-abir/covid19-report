# covid19-report

COVID-19 Report is a website where you can see the total number of affected people, total number of recovered people, total number of deaths worldwide. Also you can custom select the country to see this information. I have fetched this data from an API link which I collect from the postman website. I have used functional based components or react hooks in this site. Also I have added a line graph which is imported from react-chartjs-2 to see how the virus is growing in a country.
